# Steps

1. ## Importing dataset from kaggle
2. ## Extracting the zip file
3. ## As Mobilenetv2 is used, it should be in 224x 224 pixels, Scaling the images
4. ## Resizing all the images
5. ## Creating labels for resized images for dogs and cats

    ## Cat -> 0

    ## Dog -> 1

6. ## Couting images of dogs and cats out of 2000 images
7. ## Train test split
8. ## Scaling the data
9. ## Building the neural network
